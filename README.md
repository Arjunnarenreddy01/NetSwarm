# NetSwarm
🕸️ Decentralized Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System with Smart Routing
Name: NetSwarm

🚀 Idea Overview:
Build your own lightweight BitTorrent-style file sharing protocol and client-server network where:

Nodes can host and download files from other peers.

There's no central server — everything is distributed.

Implements your own routing algorithm, chunk splitting, and replication logic.

Includes a web UI for uploading/downloading/searching from connected peers.

Basically, you're building a distributed file system that works across machines. Like a simplified IPFS + uTorrent built from scratch.

💡 Why it’s special:
Zero AI, all about OS, networking, algorithms, file systems, hashing, protocols, and concurrency.

Few students can claim they’ve implemented something like this, let alone with efficient routing.

It's complex, technically challenging, and very impressive in interviews.

🛠️ Tech Stack Breakdown
✅ What you already know:
Python/C++: For implementing the protocol layer.

React + Django: For the frontend + backend management.

SQL/Firebase: For storing file metadata and user sessions if needed.

OS concepts: For concurrency, sockets, threads, I/O buffering.

🌱 What you’ll pick up:
Custom Networking Protocols – Build your own TCP-like logic using sockets or even UDP with retries.

Kademlia-like DHT – Distributed Hash Table for finding peers.

Content-based Hashing – Like Git or IPFS, break files into content-addressed chunks.

Concurrency & Fault Tolerance – Handle peer joins/leaves/crashes dynamically.

Chunk Replication + Versioning – For resilience and consistency.

🔍 Core Features:
Peer Discovery: Nodes find each other without a central registry.

Chunked File Sharing: Files are split into blocks, downloaded in parallel.

Smart Routing: Use a DHT or custom heuristics to choose fastest sources.

Resilience: If a peer drops, others can take over serving the file.

Web Interface: Upload a file, share its link with friends in the network.

✨ Bonus Ideas:
Add a CLI client like netswarm fetch [hash].

Build an overlay network visualizer in React showing live peer connections.

Introduce end-to-end encryption with public keys.

Optionally run it over LAN or as a local backup system for devices.

This project makes you look like someone who understands distributed systems, networking, and deep architecture — stuff that top backend or infra teams (like at Google or Redpanda or Arista) love to see.
